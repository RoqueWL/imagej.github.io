The original ImageJ has been under continuous development since 1997. It has always been, and continues to be, a project of {% include person id='rasband' %}, with the help of many contributers. It was initially developed in 1997 as a cross-platform version of [NIH Image](/software/nih-image). ImageJ grew organically over time as {% include person id='rasband' %} continued to add features according to user requests. Now there are many hundreds, probably thousands, of plugins written by members of a diverse community.

This website refers to the original version of ImageJ as **ImageJ 1.x** in places where it is important to distinguish it from [other flavors of ImageJ](/software/imagej). You may also sometimes see it called "plain ImageJ" or "ImageJ1" or "IJ1" by the community, but "ImageJ 1.x" is the preferred way to differentiate it from other ImageJ flavors.

The other main flavor of ImageJ, a redesign started in 2010, is known as [ImageJ2](/software/imagej2), to differentiate it from ImageJ 1.x. The [Fiji](/software/fiji) distribution of ImageJ bundles both ImageJ 1.x and ImageJ2, including ImageJ2's [backwards compatibility layer](/libs/imagej-legacy) to transparently convert between ImageJ 1.x and ImageJ2 data structures as needed.
